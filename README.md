# AJS-Restaurant

to run : ```npm install``` then   ```npm start```

This projet has created in me a personal hate for angularJS, it never works when you want it to and work randomly when you don't need it to work. I am VERY happy that it is depricated and dying and should never be used by anyone, ever !! Long live [angular cli](https://cli.angular.io/) !!
