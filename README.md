# AJS-Restaurant

to run : ```npm install``` then ```npm start```

This projet has created in me a personal hate for angularJS, it never works when you want it to and work randomly when you don't need it to work. I am VERY happy that it is depricated and dying and should never be used by anyone, ever !! Long live [angular cli](https://cli.angular.io/) !!
I LOST (yes lost, i learnt nothing because it was wayy to frustrating) way to much time on this and i hope that i will never work on angular js ever again.

## bugs of this shitty app

- scope is not maintained when switching pages
- modifying the grade obviously doesnt work
- the rest service was not made, no time (and i don't wanna spend more time on angularjs)
- imposible to delete a restaurant
- adding a restaurant doesnt add the email (i suppose its because i don't verify taht it is a valid email adress)
- there is only one controller, no time to learn how to make another one, and when i did it made everything crash
- tons of over bugs...
